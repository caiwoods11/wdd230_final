      <p class="about-content">
        Resumes today follow the same format to make sure they contain
        keywords to get noticed by HR automation systems. So, when anyone can
        put jargon and terminology on a resume that sounds impressive, how
        does one candidate stand out more than the next? I build websites that
        contain a career portfolio with projects that clients want to share
        with future employers or further their networking abilities within a
        wide variety of professional backgrounds.
